# EX 31 C program to find the smallest among three numbers using Structure.
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a C program to find the smallest among three numbers using Structure.

## Algorithm
1. Start.
2. Define a variables a,b,c.
3. Write program to find the smallest among the three numbers.
4. Read the value using scanf.
5. Ask the user to make an input.
6. Print out the answer.
7. End  

## Program:
```
#include<stdio.h> 
int main()
{
int a,b,c; 
scanf("%d%d%d",&a,&b,&c); 
if(a<b && a<c)
{
printf("%d is the smallest number.",a);
}
else if(b<a && b<c)
{
printf("%d is the smallest number.",b);
}
else
{
printf("%d is the smallest number.",c);
}
}
```

## Output:
