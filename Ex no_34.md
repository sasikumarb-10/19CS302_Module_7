## AIM:
To write a C program to read a file name from user and create that file and insert student roll numbers in to that file.

## Algorithm
1. . Start.
2. Define a variables.
3. Write a program to read a file name from user and create that file and insert student

float m; 
scanf("%s",name);
scanf("%d",&num);
p=fopen("name","w"); 
printf("%s Opened\n",name);
{
scanf("%d %s %f",&id,text,&m); 
fprintf(p,"%d %s %f",id,text,m);
}
fclose(p);
